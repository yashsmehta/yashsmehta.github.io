Hi! I will be working on <ins>multimodal foundation models</ins>, focused on applications in healthcare. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained valuable experience in various domains, including <ins>transformers</ins>, <ins>LLMs</ins>, <ins>neuroscience</ins>, and <ins>cognition</ins>. I am currently a research engineer at Janelia working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience with [James Fitzgerald](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0G6AMtcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Jan Funke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7rqAapgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). Specifically, Iâ€™m working on meta-learning synaptic plasticity rules in a connectome-constrained artificial neural network.

I am very fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to work with brilliant researchers, who have really inspired me and shaped my attitude towards research. I have worked on Neural Architecture Search in [Frank Hutter](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YUrxwrkAAAAJ&hl=en)'s **AutoML lab** in the most lovely town of Freiburg! Before that, I had an amazing time at the **Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit** at UCL, where I was working on evaluating biologically plausible perturbation-based learning algorithms to train deep networks with [Tim Lillicrap](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htPVdRMAAAAJ&hl) at **DeepMind** and [Peter Latham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wmqntyEAAAAJ&hl=en). I did my undergraduate thesis at **NTU Singapore** with [Erik Cambria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ilSYpW0AAAAJ&hl=en) on using large language models for personality prediction. I quit my software development job at **Amazon** to dive into research full time ;)

I thoroughly enjoy coding and working on hard algorithmic problems.
