<div class="intro-section">
I'm a third-year grad student in Computational Cognitive Science, working with [Mick Bonner](https://bonnerlab.org/), studying representations in biological and artificial neural networks. My research investigates how brains and AI systems learn to internally represent information. My background is in CS, and I've also worked as a software engineer. I'm doing research on AI agents for neuroscientific discovery, helping us understand the computational principles in visual processing. I'm excited about startups, AI (no shit!), traveling (experiences!), swim/bike training (david goggins 🙏🏻), and coffee ☕ I have also built the following tools:

I've had the opportunity to explore several research areas and work in different labs in 🇺🇸, 🇯🇵, 🇩🇪, 🇬🇧, 🇸🇬, and 🇮🇳. Here are some of the topics I've worked on:

- **Representations in biological and artificial networks** 🧠
[<span class="conf-badge">2025 (under review)</span>](https://github.com/yashsmehta/visreps/tree/main)
    [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'24</span>](https://yashsmehta.com/plasticity-paper-website/) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'22</span>](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/cf38eb1549024cce4b3d2c1bb87a6c27-Abstract-Conference.html) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'21</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13031)
- **Neural architecture search** 🔍
    [<span class="conf-badge">ICLR'22</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13396)
- **Large language models for personality trait prediction** 🤖
    [<span class="conf-badge">IEEE ICDM'20</span>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9338428) [<span class="conf-badge">AI Review'20</span>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-019-09770-z) [<span class="conf-badge">FGCS'22</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22002229)

I also completed a short PhD rotation project at *Harvard Medical School* with [Pranav Rajpurkar](https://pranavrajpurkar.com/), focusing on knowledge graphs for automating radiology report generation.
