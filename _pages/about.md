Hi! I'm a researcher working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience at the Funke Lab, [HHMI Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/). Iâ€™m working on meta-learning biologically plausible plasticity rules in a connectome constraint neural network model. 

I am very fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to work with brilliant researchers, who have really inspired me and shaped my attitude towards research. I have worked on Neural Architecture Search with Prof [Frank Hutter](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YUrxwrkAAAAJ&hl=en) (ELLIS Fellow) in the most lovely town of Freiburg! Before that, I had an amazing time at the **Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit** at UCL, where I was working on evaluating biologically plausible perturbation-based learning algorithms to train deep networks under the guidance of Prof [Peter Latham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wmqntyEAAAAJ&hl=en) (Gatsby, UCL) and [Tim Lillicrap](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htPVdRMAAAAJ&hl) (DeepMind). My undergraduate thesis on deep learning-based personality prediction with Prof [Erik Cambria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ilSYpW0AAAAJ&hl=en) (NTU SIngapore) is what got me fired up about research in the first place, eventually leading to quit my job at Amazon and dive into research full time ;)

I thoroughly enjoy coding and working on hard algorithmic problems.
