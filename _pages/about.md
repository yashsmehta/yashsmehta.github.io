Welcome to my academic website! I'm an engineer at heart with a deep learning background and a computer science degree. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in computational cognitive science at **Johns Hopkins University** and am a visiting PhD student at **Harvard Medical School**. My goal is to apply ideas from cognitive science to develop more advanced and effective <ins>AI systems in healthcare</ins>. Although my journey has been unconventional, it has been extremely rewarding. I've been fortunate to work on exciting projects alongside passionate and brilliant scientists, which has inspired me and shaped my approach to research. Some of the areas I have worked on include <ins>transformers</ins>, <ins>LLMs</ins>, <ins>neuroscience</ins>, and <ins>cognition</ins>. Prior to embarking on my research career, I worked briefly as a developer at Amazon.

I am deeply passionate about mentoring and guiding students interested in research. Each week, I set aside some time to chat with aspiring researchers. If you'd like to have a conversation, feel free to reach out to me directly.
