<div class="intro-section">
I'm a PhD student in Computational Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, studying representations in *biological* and *artificial* neural networks. My research explores the parallels between how brains and AI systems learn to internally represent and information. In summer 2025, I'm working at [Sakana AI](https://sakana.ai/) as a research scientist intern, working on *autonomous systems for open-ended scientific discovery*. I also co-founded an early-stage AI startup and previously was a software developer at **Amazon**.

### Research experience
I've had the opportunity to explore several research areas and work in different labs in 🇺🇸, 🇯🇵, 🇩🇪, 🇬🇧, 🇸🇬, and 🇮🇳. Here are some of the topics I've worked on:

- **Representations in biological and artificial networks** 🧠  
[<span class="conf-badge">2025 (under review)</span>](https://github.com/yashsmehta/visreps/tree/main)
    [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'24</span>](https://yashsmehta.com/plasticity-paper-website/) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'22</span>](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/cf38eb1549024cce4b3d2c1bb87a6c27-Abstract-Conference.html) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'21</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13031)
- **Neural architecture search** 🔍  
    [<span class="conf-badge">ICLR'22</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13396)
- **Large language models for personality trait prediction** 🤖  
    [<span class="conf-badge">IEEE ICDM'20</span>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9338428) [<span class="conf-badge">AI Review'20</span>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-019-09770-z) [<span class="conf-badge">FGCS'22</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22002229)

I also completed a short PhD rotation project at *Harvard Medical School*, focusing on knowledge graphs for automating radiology report generation.
