I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Cognitive Science at **Johns Hopkins University** and am a visiting PhD student at **Harvard Medical School**. My research aims to bridge cognitive science and artificial intelligence to improve AI applications in healthcare. 

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the privilege of collaborating with many talented scientists and engaging in diverse research projects. My areas of interest include <ins>foundation models</ins>, <ins>cognition</ins>, and <ins>computational neuroscience</ins>. Below is the list of labs and mentors I have worked with.
