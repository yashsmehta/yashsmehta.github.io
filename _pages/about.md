Hi! I'm a research engineer working at the intersection of deep learning and neuroscience with [James Fitzgerald](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0G6AMtcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and [Jan Funke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7rqAapgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) at the ***HHMI Janelia Research Campus***. Specifically, Iâ€™m working on meta-learning synaptic plasticity rules in a connectome-constrained artificial neural network.

I am very fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to work with brilliant researchers, who have really inspired me and shaped my attitude towards research. I have worked on Neural Architecture Search in [Frank Hutter](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YUrxwrkAAAAJ&hl=en)'s ***AutoML lab*** in the most lovely town of Freiburg! Before that, I had an amazing time at the ***Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit*** at UCL, where I was working on evaluating biologically plausible perturbation-based learning algorithms to train deep networks with [Peter Latham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wmqntyEAAAAJ&hl=en) (Gatsby, UCL) and [Tim Lillicrap](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htPVdRMAAAAJ&hl) (DeepMind). My undergraduate thesis on deep learning-based personality prediction with [Erik Cambria](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ilSYpW0AAAAJ&hl=en) (NTU SIngapore) is what got me fired up about research in the first place, eventually leading to quit my job at Amazon and dive into research full time ;)

I thoroughly enjoy coding and working on hard algorithmic problems.
