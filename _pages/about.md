Welcome to my academic website! I'm an engineer at heart with a deep learning background and a computer science degree. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in cognitive science at **Hopkins** and am a visiting PhD student at **Harvard Medical School**. My goal is to apply ideas from cognitive science to develop more advanced and effective <ins>AI systems in healthcare</ins>. Although my journey has been unconventional, it has been incredibly rewarding. I've had the privilege of working in exceptional labs alongside inspiring mentors who have greatly influenced my approach to research. Some research areas I have worked on are <ins>transformers</ins>, <ins>LLMs</ins>, <ins>neuroscience</ins>, and <ins>cognition</ins>. Prior to my research career, I worked briefly as a developer at Amazon.

I am passionate about mentoring and guiding students interested in research. I dedicate one hour each week to discuss research topics and provide guidance to aspiring researchers. If you are interested in having a conversation, please feel free to reach out to me directly.
