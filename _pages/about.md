<div class="intro-section">
I'm a second-year PhD student in Computational Cognitive Science, with a background in computer science. My research is at the intersection of <u>deep learning</u>, <u>multimodality</u>, and <u>cognitive science</u>. I'm also drawn to robotics and am curious about ways to boost research productivity‚Äîwhether through tools, habits, or fresh ideas. A long time ago, I worked as a software developer at *Amazon*, but left to pursue research.

### Research experience
My path to research has been anything but traditional. Along the way, I've explored topics like:
- **Biologically inspired learning algorithms** üß†  
    [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'24</span>](https://yashsmehta.com/plasticity-paper-website/) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'22</span>](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/cf38eb1549024cce4b3d2c1bb87a6c27-Abstract-Conference.html) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'21</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13031)
- **Neural architecture search** üîç  
    [<span class="conf-badge">ICLR'22</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13396)
- **Large language models for personality trait prediction** ü§ñ  
    [<span class="conf-badge">IEEE ICDM'20</span>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9338428) [<span class="conf-badge">AI Review'20</span>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-019-09770-z) [<span class="conf-badge">FGCS'22</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22002229)

I also completed a short PhD rotation project at *Harvard Medical School*, focusing on knowledge graphs for automating radiology report generation.
