Y Combinator hosted its inaugural AI Startup School on June 16-17 in San Francisco, bringing together about 2,500 ambitious students from across the globe. Initially, I questioned the value of enduring jet lag and a long flight from Tokyo for just a two-day conference. But in retrospect, it was absolutely worth it. Beyond the impressive lineup—Gary Tan, Sam Altman, Jared Kaplan, John Jumper, Andrej Karpathy, François Chollet, Elon Musk, Andrew Ng, and Satya Nadella—what stood out was the stimulating environment. I decided to document this experience primarily to distill my thoughts, clarify my learnings, and deepen my understanding. The insights here reflect my interpretations and takeaways, not necessarily the exact viewpoints of the speakers.

#### Agency and Team Building
Garry Tan's idea of "agency scales" resonated deeply with me. Agency refers to team members who proactively execute rather than merely discuss, plan, or attend meetings. These individuals have intrinsic motivation aligned with the company's vision and require minimal traditional management. With AI amplifying individual capabilities, small, high-agency teams have become an essential asset for startups.

#### Unchanging Success Mindset
Gary highlighted, "The tools change, the mindset doesn't." Success fundamentally depends on direct user engagement. His approach emphasizes initially deploying products to just 10 users, then rapidly and continuously refining based on feedback until users truly love the product. Only then should scaling and marketing efforts begin. Depth of engagement precedes breadth.

#### Transformation of Software and Work
Sam Altman provocatively asked, "Is SaaS dead?" He predicts that software quality expectations will rise dramatically, resulting in specialized teams building highly targeted software solutions. There's currently a large gap between AI model capabilities and actual products, creating significant startup opportunities. During major technological shifts, startups often outperform incumbents due to agility.

Consulting faces disruption as AI empowers individuals to independently access information. Enhanced individual capabilities underscore the importance of small, high-agency teams.

#### Building the Right Team
Sam's advice on team building for startups challenges conventional wisdom. Rather than recruiting highly experienced big names—an approach aligned with Elon Musk's preference for maintaining a low ego-to-agency ratio—Sam advocates for hiring highly optimistic individuals who believe in eventual success. Interestingly, attracting team members becomes easier when pursuing ambitious, impactful goals. Sam describes building a startup as "the best yet hardest thing you'll ever do," akin to parenting.

#### Product and Interface Evolution
Sam cited AI memory capabilities as his favorite emerging feature, pointing to future personalized AI agents integrated with services and proactive user interactions. Technology interfaces will increasingly become subtle, personalized, and seamlessly integrated into daily life, as demonstrated by companies like IO.

### Future of Human-AI Interaction
Expanding on these insights, I foresee a radical shift in human-technology interaction. The current smartphone interface will soon feel outdated, giving way to more seamless, voice-driven interactions, possibly through augmented reality smart glasses. Physical keyboards will become obsolete.

The critical role of ultra-high-speed internet will grow significantly, enabling frontier AI computations in the cloud with interactions primarily via voice. Visual outputs will likely be delivered through unobtrusive smart glasses or VR headsets integrated into everyday environments. Mobility will be paramount, transforming every surface into an interactive screen. Ultimately, personal computing power will become secondary to robust cloud connectivity.

  <h3>François Chollet</h3>
</div>

#### Rethinking Intelligence
Chollet challenged prevailing AI progress assumptions, emphasizing that true intelligence, or "fluid intelligence," involves adaptive generalization rather than benchmark-driven memorization. He underscored that scaling models alone does not yield fluid intelligence, as demonstrated by the ARC-AGI benchmark results.

#### Two Visions of AGI
François differentiated between Minsky's task-automation AGI vision and McCarthy's adaptability-oriented approach. He argued for innovation-driven intelligence over automation-focused benchmarks, advocating for models optimized for adaptive generalization rather than memorization.

#### Path to Fluid Intelligence
Achieving fluid intelligence requires extracting and recombining abstract concepts from prior experiences dynamically. Chollet distinguished between Type 1 (value-level abstractions) and Type 2 (program-level abstractions), noting that Transformers excel at Type 1 but achieving true fluidity necessitates leveraging Type 1 to efficiently navigate Type 2's combinatorial complexity.

### General Insights

#### You Don't Need SOTA Models
A key takeaway is that building AI startups significantly differs from AI research. Cutting-edge models aren't necessary for success. For instance, one startup effectively used basic logistic regression in steel manufacturing optimization, generating $1M revenue with a simple algorithm for a highly specific use case.

**Key takeaway:** Rapidly build a functional prototype and deploy it to users. Your solution doesn't need to be research-level or employ advanced models.

#### B2C vs. B2B
- **B2C:** Selling directly to consumers can yield massive rewards if the product resonates strongly (e.g., Cursor). However, breakout consumer successes remain uncommon.
- **B2B:** Selling to enterprises is typically more straightforward. An illustrative example is a consultant from South Africa serving global pharma enterprises with basic AI tool proficiency rather than deep expertise.

#### Enterprise Pitch Strategy
A compelling enterprise pitch often boils down to demonstrating clear financial value: "You're currently spending X on a process; I can reduce it by 50% while maintaining or improving outcomes."

This works because:
- Large corporations struggle to keep pace with rapid AI advancements.
- Enterprises lack internal expertise to integrate AI effectively.
- Non-tech industries are particularly fertile grounds for such solutions.
- Even straightforward applications using Claude and basic coding skills can be highly profitable in enterprise consulting.

#### Founder Observations
- First-time founders typically guard their ideas closely.
- Second-time founders freely share ideas to gather early feedback and users.
- Additionally, many young founders overly associate their identities with prestigious universities or companies, which can negatively impact networking.

#### Happy Robot After-Party
Engaging with the successful Happy Robot founders (YC alumni) highlighted the deep personal bonds among co-founders—two brothers and college friends—which significantly contributed to their resilience during challenging periods.

They described "pivot hell," a common, painful experience for startups navigating toward product-market fit. The strength of founder relationships often determines success during these pivots.

#### Random Reflections
- A portion of the startup community involves superficial self-promotion (start up because it's cool), especially among younger founders.
- Successful entrepreneurs openly discuss their struggles and are notably direct.
- **Main lesson:** Prioritize solving tangible, user-centric problems over perfecting technology.
