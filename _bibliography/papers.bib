  abstract={Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change their strength, is a key mechanism underlying learning in biological neural networks. However, inferring plasticity rules from neural recordings is challenging due to the complexity of biological networks and the difficulty of measuring synaptic weights directly. Here, we introduce a model-based approach to infer plasticity rules from neural activity alone, without requiring direct measurement of synaptic weights.},
