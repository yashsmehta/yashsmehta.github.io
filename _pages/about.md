<div class="intro-section">
I'm a PhD student in Computational Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University, researching at the intersection of **AI** and **human cognition**. My current projects involve modeling human vision with neural networks and creating AI agents to accelerate scientific discovery. From summer 2025, I'll be a research scientist intern at [Sakana AI](https://sakana.ai/), developing agents designed to enhance scientific research workflows. I'm also co-founder of an early-stage AI startup. Previously, I worked as a software developer at Amazon.

### Research experience
I've had the opportunity to explore several research areas and work in different labs in 🇺🇸, 🇩🇪, 🇬🇧, 🇸🇬, and 🇮🇳. Here are some of the topics I've worked on:

- **Biologically inspired learning algorithms** 🧠  
    [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'24</span>](https://yashsmehta.com/plasticity-paper-website/) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'22</span>](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/cf38eb1549024cce4b3d2c1bb87a6c27-Abstract-Conference.html) [<span class="conf-badge">NeurIPS'21</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13031)
- **Neural architecture search** 🔍  
    [<span class="conf-badge">ICLR'22</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13396)
- **Large language models for personality trait prediction** 🤖  
    [<span class="conf-badge">IEEE ICDM'20</span>](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9338428) [<span class="conf-badge">AI Review'20</span>](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-019-09770-z) [<span class="conf-badge">FGCS'22</span>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22002229)

I also completed a short PhD rotation project at *Harvard Medical School*, focusing on knowledge graphs for automating radiology report generation.
